Tip: It’s good practice to keep a copy of the raw data you are using to extract the data you need.

By appending a date or time stamp to the file name, you can ensure it’s name is unique.
This builds a history of the weather forecasts which you can revisit at any time to recover from errors or expand the scope of your reports
Using the prescribed date format ensures that when you sort the files, they will be sorted chronologically. It also enables searching for the report for any given date.
If needed, you can compress and archive the files periodically. You can even automate this process by scheduling it.
